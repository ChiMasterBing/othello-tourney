        How are tournaments run?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Othello Tournaments follow a modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament">Swiss Tournament</a> model.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the very first round, each player is randomly matched with another player. The players who win their respective matches will have a ranking of "1".
        Every subsequent round players will be sorted by ranking and matched with another player with the most similar ranking.
        Every time a player wins a game the player's ranking will increase by 1, or 0.5 if the game ends in a tie.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no penalty for losing a game.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tournament games are started automatically in batches and can only be watched. Games started through the <a href="{% url 'games:play' %}">Play</a> page are not tournament games.
        You can view currently playing tournament games on the <a href="{% url 'games:watch' %}">Watch</a> page. Tournament games will be prepended with a "Tournament: ".
    </p>
